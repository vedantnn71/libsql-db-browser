A database browser for libsql inspired from prisma studio. This is a super simple client and only has capability to read the database and show/hide the columns right now. Contributions for adding features are always welcome.

# 🏃 Running
This project is built with nextjs and typescript. To spin up this on your machine just add the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in the `.env` file and you will be good to go. You can just run the `pnpm dev` to start the dev server or `pnpm build` and `pnpm start` to run the production build.
